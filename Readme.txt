Install node modules by npm i. Run backend with "node index.js". Or install nodemon with "npm i nodemon -g" and then run with
"nodemon". Nodemon actually reloads backend upon any changes. If you use node index.js. You would have to run it again after any changes you make.

For react nextjs frontend. Run npm i to install all modules and then npm run dev.
